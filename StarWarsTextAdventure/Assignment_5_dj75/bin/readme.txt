As per my MO I turned in the eclipse project file.

It took me probably over 8 hours to complete this project

I did both the vision potion and the pit extra credit
I modified how the vision potion works because I thought it would make sense to only be able to see the rooms connected by doors to the room you're in

I think the hardest parts of this assignment for me where having to write a ton of methods, and figuring out the formatting of the strings when I print the dungeon or the rooms around another room
I couldn't figure out how to make the rooms print next to each other with the *'s,|'s, and -'s around them so I just settled for a super simplistic approach and printed the room types next to each other (i.e. XHV).

I have a question that's unrelated to this assignment, I resubmited programming assignment 3 and emailed you about it like we talked about and I was wondering if you'd take a look. I know you're very busy I just wanted to make sure that you knew

Thank you for an awesome quarter! You're a great professor and I look forward to taking future classes with you.
