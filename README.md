# StarWarsTextAdventure
 
This is a project I made for a class. It's a text dungeon adventure where you have two find two items to exit the dungeon. When you enter a room theres a random chance to fall into a pit, fight a moster, or get one of two types of potions.

I do not own any of the Star Wars property, the sole rights of the Star Wars property are held by the Walt Disney Company.
